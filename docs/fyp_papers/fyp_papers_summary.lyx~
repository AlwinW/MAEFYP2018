NACA4612 airfoil in viscous flow, Re = 1000 and

 focusing on the starting and stopping vortices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the flow around a streamlined body is accelerated or decelerated, starting
 and stopping vortices are shed from the trailing edge of the body, respectively
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with constant density and viscosity
 in an inertial frame of reference were solved with OpenFOAM using a linear
 upwind finite volume method (FVM) for the space discretization and the
 implicit Euler method for the time integration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The flow visualizations of Prandtl were analyzed by (Willert and Kompenhans,
 2010) using particle image ve- locimetry (PIV) to compute and visualize
 the vorticity of the flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inviscid Flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The simplest approach is to analyze the forces caused by the motion of an
 ideal fluid without viscosity.
 This kind of flow is known as potential flow and it is based on the assumption
 that the flow is irrotational, that is, the vorticity of the field is zero
 everywhere.
 The vorticity is a kinematic flow variable defined as the curl of the velocity
 field:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{\omega}=\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{V}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One of the drawbacks of the potential flow theory is that it fails to predict
 the drag felt by a body moving with constant velocity, relative to the
 fluid, caused by the viscous stresses (it accounts for drag due to pressure
 and acceleration though).
 This is known as the D’Alembert’s paradox.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One of the most important results of the potential flow theory is the Kutta-Jouk
owski lift theorem.
 This theorem states that the lift force per unit of depth experienced by
 a cylinder with arbitrary shape immersed in a fluid with uniform free-stream
 velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 and constant density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=-\rho V_{\infty}\Gamma\tag{eq 4}
\]

I should be able to easily check if this is always true! Take the forces

\end_layout

\begin_inset Newline newline

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is the circulation around the solid body, which is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Gamma=\ointop_{C}\vec{V}\cdot\text{d}\vec{l}\tag{eq 5}
\]

\end_inset

The integral in eq 5 is performed in a counter clockwise sense and the minus
 sign of eq 4 indicates that a negative circulation leads to a positive
 force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At the beginning the velocity is zero everywhere and so is the circulation
 around the airfoil.
 When the airfoil starts to move, the fluid flows around the airfoil, but
 the circulation will still be zero because the vorticity is zero everywhere...
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Gamma=\ointop_{C}\vec{V}\cdot\text{d}\vec{l}=\iintop_{S}\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{v}\cdot\text{d}S=\iintop_{S}\vec{\omega}\cdot\text{d}\vec{S}
\]

\end_inset

The inconsistency of the potential flow theory is now apparent, it predicts
 that the lift force is proportional to the circulation, but at the same
 time the circulation must be zero because the flow is irrotational.

Kelvin’s theorem is an important result related with circulation and vorticity.
 This theorem states that in an inviscid, constant density flow with conservativ
e body forces, the circulation associated with a closed curve moving with
 the fluid does not change with time.

Viscous Flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Consider now an airfoil at rest within a stationary viscous fluid that is
 suddenly accelerated to 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0^{+}$
\end_inset

.
 The Γ = ~ V · d ~ l (5) arguments presented in this section are briefly
 considered in (White, 2011, Chapter 7 and 8) and (National Committee for
 Fluid Mechanics Films, 1972), and discussed in more detail in (Kundu and
 Cohen, 2002, Chapter 15) and (Batchelor, 2000, Chapter 6).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the fluid is at rest the velocity and vorticity are zero everywhere
 so is the circulation around any closed contour 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 that contains the airfoil.
 When the fluid motion starts the viscous boundary layers start to grow
 close to the surfaces of the airfoil, but at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0^{+}$
\end_inset

 the vorticity is still zero everywhere and the potential solution corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma=0$
\end_inset

, as shown in Figure 2, still holds.
 The flow pattern contains two stagnation points, one in the leading edge
 of the airfoil and the other on the upper side, close to the trailing edge.
 The trailing stagnation point is not exactly at the trailing edge the the
 flow turns abruptly at flow the lower side to the upper side at the trailing
 edge.
 In fact, the potential flow theory predicts an unphysical infinite velocity
 at the trailing edge.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The potential flow solution is valid at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0^{+}$
\end_inset

, even if the fluid has viscosity, because the vorticity is generated at
 the finite rate close to the airfoil walls and it needs time to be convected
 and diffused to the main flow.
 The transport of vorticity in 2D incompressible flow is described by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\text{D}\vec{\omega}}{\text{D}t}=\nu\nabla^{2}\vec{\omega}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When 
\begin_inset Formula $t>0$
\end_inset

 the boundary layers start to grow and the vorticity generated close to
 the walls is transported by the flow.
 Clockwise vorticity is generated on the upper side of the airfoil while
 counter-clockwise vorticity is created on the lower side of the airfoil.
 The velocity of the fluid is large at the trailing edge as it flows from
 the lower to the upper side (see Figure 3) and the flow is decelerated
 as it approaches the stagnation point.
 This deceleration causes an adverse pressure gradient that in turn leads
 to the separation of the boundary layer and backflow.
 As a result of this backflow, a counter-clockwise vortex is formed at the
 trailing edge of the airfoil.
 With the passing of time, the stagnation point is displaced closer the
 the trailing edge and the vortex is convected downstream by the flow.
 Eventually, the stagnation point occurs at the trailing edge, as pictured
 in Figure 4 and Figure 5.
 This situation is known as the Kutta condition.

The reason why both integrals have to sum zero is explained with Kelvin’s
 circulation theorem.
 If the circulation integral of Figure 6 is evaluated around an inviscid
 integration path far away from the airfoil, then the value of the circulation
 must have remained constant at all times and, since 
\begin_inset Formula $Γ=0$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, the circulation around < aefgcd > must be zero at all times

The situation when an airfoil starts its motion within a fluid at rest is
 very similar.
 In this case a starting vortex is also formed but instead of being convected
 downstream with the flow, it remains in the same location where it was
 generated while the airfoil moves away from the vortex.
 On the other hand, if the vortex is rapidly decelerated a clockwise stopping
 vortex will also be formed.

The displacement of the airfoil as a function of time is plot in Figure
 12 for the case of the suddenly started airfoil and in Figure 15 for the
 case of the suddenly started and stopped airfoil.
 However, when the airfoil accelerates from rest, the frame of reference
 for the relative velocity field is non-inetial and Eq.
 14 has to be modified to include the non-inertial effects (fictitious forces):
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\text{D}\vec{V}}{\text{D}t}=-\frac{\vec{\nabla}p}{\rho}+\nu\nabla^{2}\vec{V}-\vec{a}\tag{Eq 16}

 appears in the equation 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

As it can be seen from Eq.
 16, the acceleration term behaves as a body force (similar to gravity)
 acting in the direction opposite to the acceleration of the airfoil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Acceleration was ignored in this solution...
 body forces not solved...
 For this velocity distribution the acceleration term peaked at a ≈ 25 m/s
 2 ≈ 2.5g.
 The gravity term is usu- ally negligible in most aerodynamic applications
 and, in this problem, the forces due to the acceleration term are of the
 same order of magnitude as gravity.
 In addition, the acceleration term is only acting for very short periods
 of time when the airfoil is impulsively started or stopped.
 For these reasons, it seems reasonable to neglect the effect of the acceleratio
n in this problem.

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The most remarkable result is the sudden jump of the lift and drag when
 the acceleration occurs and the little impact that viscosity has on the
 value of the coefficients during this acceleration.
 The low influence of the viscous stresses is striking considering that,
 as discussed in Section 2.3, viscosity is responsible for the formation
 of the starting vortex and the development of the circulation that leads
 to the lift force in steady state.

The large drag during acceleration is not caused by the viscous stresses,
 instead it is an added mass effect resulting from the pressure distribution
 that arises when the airfoil accelerates the fluid around it (note the
 close relation between the acceleration peaks and the lift and drag peaks).
 Another interesting result is the negative peak of lift and drag when the
 airfoil is decelerated.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once the lift and drag coefficients were computed it was found that both
 peaked during the accelerations and decelerations due to added mass effects
 and that the effect of the viscous stresses on lift was modest even if
 viscosity is responsible for the development of lift.
 In addition, the solution was verified using the Kelvin’s circulation theorem.
 Both the line integral of the velocity and the surface integral of vorticity
 matched with reasonable accuracy and were almost equal to zero for an inviscid
 contour and non-zero for viscid contours.

 The first term on the right is a processing term describing the local amplifica
tion (or concentration) of vorticity by stretching and tilting the vortex
 filaments.
 The second term on the right represents viscous diffusion, i.e.
 the spreading of vorticity due to viscosity.
 For homogeneous fluid, vorticity is generated only at boundaries.
 Batchelor (1967) concluded that the boundary conditions on vorticity are
 given, in effect, by those on velocity.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Morton (2984) sought a dynamic formation for the generation of vorticity:
 he focused on the flow next to a solid wall and concluded that vorticity
 is generated at boundaries by the relative acceleration of fluid and wall.
 This vorticity is produced instantaneously, either from the fluid side
 by tangential pressure gradients, or from the wall side by acceleration
 of the boundary, and this generation is partially masked by viscous diffusion
 when there is continuing production.
 Morton (1984) also found that for an impulsive change,w all stress does
 not produce vorticity, and that the only means of decay or loss of circulation
 is by cross-diffusion and annihilation of vorticity of opposite signs.

Abstract & Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this paper we describe a detailed study of the wake structures and flow
 dynamics associated with simulated two-dimensional flows past a circular
 cylinder that is either stationary or in simple harmonic cross-flow oscillation.
 Results are examined for Re = 500 and a fixed motion amplitude of y max
 /D = 0.25
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Results are interpreted using an analysis of vorticity generation and transport
 in the base region of the cylinder.
 We suggest that the dynamics of the change in phase of shedding arise from
 a competition between two different mechanisms of vorticity production.

The Reynolds number was set sufficiently high for the switch phenomenon
 to be observed at the oscillation amplitude employed.
 The restriction to a single amplitude and Reynolds number, and especially
 to two-dimensional computations, was made in order to contain the demand

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Understanding this type of fluid–structure interaction is made more complicated
 by the difficulty of visualizing and measuring the large-scale separated
 flow near a moving body.
 More fundamentally, the flows are complex and time-varying, and there are
 few theoretical results available to guide interpretation.
 We have taken a numerical simulation approach in order to overcome the
 operational difficulties and better understand the physical processes involved.

A spectral element spatial discretization was employed in conjunction with
 a second-order time-splitting scheme (Karniadakis, Israeli & Orszag 1991)
 in order to solve the two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.
 The solver uses a primitive-variable formulation.
 Vorticity, when required for presentation of results, was computed in post-proc
essing.
 Details of the method, its application to two-dimensional and three-dimensional
 simulations and stability analyses of fixed cylinder wakes, and comparisons
 with experimental results are discussed in Hen- derson & Karniadakis (1995),
 Henderson (1995), Barkley & Henderson (1996) and Henderson (1997).

\begin_layout Itemize
Four key concepts can be used as aids to interpretation of vorticity contours.
 First, continuity demands that separation and (re)attachment points must
 occur in pairs for a two-dimensional flow.
 Second, in the frame of reference of the body, separation and attachment
 occur at points of zero surface vorticity, as may be verified by a study
 of figure 4.
 Both these concepts are dealt with in detail by Lighthill (1963).
 Third, in an incompressible flow, vorticity production can only occur at
 a solid boundary in response to wall-tangential components of pressure
 gradient and/or boundary acceleration.
 For a two-dimensional flow of a Newtonian incompressible fluid the equation
 for the vorticity source strength at solid walls in an inertial reference
 frame reads (Morton 1984; Hornung 1989):
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\nu\vec{n}\cdot\nabla\vec{\omega}=-\vec{n}\times\left(\nabla\vec{P}+\vec{a}\right)\tag{Eq 6.1}
\]

\end_inset

This equation expresses the idea that vorticity must diffuse away from a
 solid boundary at the same rate that it is produced by local conditions.
 Fourth, for flow past a body that has no angular acceleration, the integral
 around the body perimeter of the flux of vorticity is zero at every instant,
 which is a consequence of (6.1) and the continuity of the pressure field:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ointop-\nu\vec{n}\cdot\nabla\vec{\omega}\,\text{d}S=\ointop-\nu\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial n}\,\text{d}S=0

When the cylinder accelerates downwards (as in figures 5a–c and f–h) this
 mechanism acts to produce fluxes of negative vorticity on the front cylinder
 face and positive vorticity on the rear face.
 Quantitatively these fluxes are of larger magnitude in figure 5(f–j ) since
 the acceleration is larger than in 5(a–e) by the square of the ratio of
 the frequency ratios (a factor of 1.24).

Competition between vorticity generation mechanisms:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The key feature is the relative strengths of, and competition between, the
 pressure gradient and motion-induced vorticity production on the basal
 surface.
 In the case of low-frequency oscillations (e.g.
 figure 5 a–e), shear layers are perturbed such that they roll up first
 on the side of the wake towards which the body is moving.
 Pressure gradients associated with this roll-up tend to induce vorticity
 of opposite sign on the basal surface (as in figure 5b, c).
 The surface-acceleration vorticity generation mechanism opposes this production
, but is not strong enough to override it.

At higher oscillation frequencies (e.g.
 figure 5 f–j ), the surface-acceleration production mechanism has been
 able to override the pressure gradient mechanism on the basal surface of
 the cylinder.
 A very intense basal shear layer forms, inducing earlier roll-up of the
 main shear layer from the opposite side of the cylinder than occurs in
 the lower frequency case.
 In turn there is a feedback effect whereby the pressure gradient produced
 in the roll-up of the main shear layer gives rise to vorticity production
 that reinforces the tangential acceleration mechanism.
 The strength of the main shear layer that is rolling up is enhanced, in
 order to achieve the balance indicated by the integral constraint (6.2).

Simulations with reduced motion-induced vorticity production:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In order to test the hypothesis that the controlling feature in the phase
 switch is the relative importance of pressure-gradient and motion-induced
 vorticity production, we have carried out simulations in which the motion-induc
ed vorticity production was lowered artificially in the manner indicated
 by (9.3).
 No modification is required to the numerical solution technique, other
 than to impose a set of time-varying velocity boundary conditions on the
 cylinder surface.
 Since the velocities are tangential, there is no direct interaction with
 the pressure through the Neumann boundary condition (5.3).

Starting from the Kármán wake solutions obtained for F = 0.875 and F = 0.975
 (as for figure 5), the relative motion of the cylinder surface was gradually
 increased from rest, by increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $β$
\end_inset

 from 0 to 1 over a period T U/D = 100 until the motion- induced vorticity
 production was zero everywhere on the circumference.
 This resulted in the F = 0.875 solution changing to another with a periodic
 Kármán street wake, and an increased value of E.
 In contrast, the periodicity of the F = 0.975 solution was destroyed by
 this procedure, leading to a chaotic wake flow.
 Subsequently it was discovered that a periodic solution could also be obtained
 at F = 0.975 if the motion-induced vorticity production was reduced by a
 lesser amount.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $β$
\end_inset

 max = 0.5 this produced a Kármán street wake, with a negative value of E,
 similar in magnitude to that for the cylinder with the fixed surface at
 the same value of F.
