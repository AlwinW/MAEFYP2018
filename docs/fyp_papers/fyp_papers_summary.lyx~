For the camber line to be a streamline, the component of the velocity normal
 to the camber line must be zero at all points along the camber...
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{\infty,n}+w'\left(s\right)=0\tag{Eq 4.12}
\]

\end_inset

 At any point 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 on the camber line, where the slope of the camber line is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\text{d}z}{\text{d}x}$
\end_inset

, the geometry of Figure 4.23 yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{\infty,n}=V_{\infty}\sin\left(\alpha+\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{\text{d}z}{\text{d}x}\right)\right)\tag{Eq 4.13}
\]

\end_inset

Using trigonometric approximations...
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{\infty,n}=V_{\infty}\left(\alpha-\frac{\text{d}z}{\text{d}x}\right)\tag{Eq 4.14}
\]

\end_inset

...
\begin_inset Formula $w'\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 is the component of the velocity normal to the camber line induced by the
 vortex sheet...If the airfoil is thin, the camber line is close to the chord
 line, and it is consistent with thin airfoil theory to make the approximation
 that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w'\left(s\right)\approx w\left(x\right)\tag{Eq 4.15}
\]

\begin_inset Formula $\xi$

\[
\text{d}w=-\frac{\gamma\left(\xi\right)\,\text{d}\xi}{2\pi\left(x-\xi\right)}\tag{Eq 4.16}

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{2\pi}\intop_{0}^{c}\frac{\gamma\left(\xi\right)\,\text{d}\xi}{x-\xi}=V_{\infty}\left(\alpha-\frac{\text{d}z}{\text{d}x}\right)\tag{Eq 4.18}

 focusing on the starting and stopping vortices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the flow around a streamlined body is accelerated or decelerated, starting
 and stopping vortices are shed from the trailing edge of the body, respectively
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with constant density and viscosity
 in an inertial frame of reference were solved with OpenFOAM using a linear
 upwind finite volume method (FVM) for the space discretization and the
 implicit Euler method for the time integration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The flow visualizations of Prandtl were analyzed by (Willert and Kompenhans,
 2010) using particle image ve- locimetry (PIV) to compute and visualize
 the vorticity of the flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inviscid Flow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The simplest approach is to analyze the forces caused by the motion of an
 ideal fluid without viscosity.
 This kind of flow is known as potential flow and it is based on the assumption
 that the flow is irrotational, that is, the vorticity of the field is zero
 everywhere.
 The vorticity is a kinematic flow variable defined as the curl of the velocity
 field:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{\omega}=\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{V}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One of the drawbacks of the potential flow theory is that it fails to predict
 the drag felt by a body moving with constant velocity, relative to the
 fluid, caused by the viscous stresses (it accounts for drag due to pressure
 and acceleration though).
 This is known as the D’Alembert’s paradox.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One of the most important results of the potential flow theory is the Kutta-Jouk
owski lift theorem.
 This theorem states that the lift force per unit of depth experienced by
 a cylinder with arbitrary shape immersed in a fluid with uniform free-stream
 velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 and constant density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=-\rho V_{\infty}\Gamma\tag{eq 4}
\]

I should be able to easily check if this is always true! Take the forces
 from the force output and the circulation by taking a contour integral
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is the circulation around the solid body, which is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Gamma=\ointop_{C}\vec{V}\cdot\text{d}\vec{l}\tag{eq 5}
\]

\end_inset

The integral in eq 5 is performed in a counter clockwise sense and the minus
 sign of eq 4 indicates that a negative circulation leads to a positive
 force
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
At the beginning the velocity is zero everywhere and so is the circulation
 around the airfoil.
 When the airfoil starts to move, the fluid flows around the airfoil, but
 the circulation will still be zero because the vorticity is zero everywhere...
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Gamma=\ointop_{C}\vec{V}\cdot\text{d}\vec{l}=\iintop_{S}\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{v}\cdot\text{d}S=\iintop_{S}\vec{\omega}\cdot\text{d}\vec{S}
\]

\end_inset

The inconsistency of the potential flow theory is now apparent, it predicts
 that the lift force is proportional to the circulation, but at the same
 time the circulation must be zero because the flow is irrotational.

Viscous Flow

\begin_layout Itemize
Consider now an airfoil at rest within a stationary viscous fluid that is
 suddenly accelerated to 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0^{+}$
\end_inset

.
 The Γ = ~ V · d ~ l (5) arguments presented in this section are briefly
 considered in (White, 2011, Chapter 7 and 8) and (National Committee for
 Fluid Mechanics Films, 1972), and discussed in more detail in (Kundu and
 Cohen, 2002, Chapter 15) and (Batchelor, 2000, Chapter 6).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When the fluid is at rest the velocity and vorticity are zero everywhere
 so is the circulation around any closed contour 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 that contains the airfoil.
 When the fluid motion starts the viscous boundary layers start to grow
 close to the surfaces of the airfoil, but at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0^{+}$
\end_inset

 the vorticity is still zero everywhere and the potential solution corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma=0$
\end_inset

, as shown in Figure 2, still holds.
 The flow pattern contains two stagnation points, one in the leading edge
 of the airfoil and the other on the upper side, close to the trailing edge.
 The trailing stagnation point is not exactly at the trailing edge the the
 flow turns abruptly at flow the lower side to the upper side at the trailing
 edge.
 In fact, the potential flow theory predicts an unphysical infinite velocity
 at the trailing edge.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The potential flow solution is valid at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0^{+}$
\end_inset

, even if the fluid has viscosity, because the vorticity is generated at
 the finite rate close to the airfoil walls and it needs time to be convected
 and diffused to the main flow.
 The transport of vorticity in 2D incompressible flow is described by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\text{D}\vec{\omega}}{\text{D}t}=\nu\nabla^{2}\vec{\omega}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When 
\begin_inset Formula $t>0$
\end_inset

 the boundary layers start to grow and the vorticity generated close to
 the walls is transported by the flow.
 Clockwise vorticity is generated on the upper side of the airfoil while
 counter-clockwise vorticity is created on the lower side of the airfoil.
 The velocity of the fluid is large at the trailing edge as it flows from
 the lower to the upper side (see Figure 3) and the flow is decelerated
 as it approaches the stagnation point.
 This deceleration causes an adverse pressure gradient that in turn leads
 to the separation of the boundary layer and backflow.
 As a result of this backflow, a counter-clockwise vortex is formed at the
 trailing edge of the airfoil.
 With the passing of time, the stagnation point is displaced closer the
 the trailing edge and the vortex is convected downstream by the flow.
 Eventually, the stagnation point occurs at the trailing edge, as pictured
 in Figure 4 and Figure 5.
 This situation is known as the Kutta condition.

The situation when an airfoil starts its motion within a fluid at rest is
 very similar.
 In this case a starting vortex is also formed but instead of being convected
 downstream with the flow, it remains in the same location where it was
 generated while the airfoil moves away from the vortex.
 On the other hand, if the vortex is rapidly decelerated a clockwise stopping
 vortex will also be formed.

As it can be seen from Eq.
 16, the acceleration term behaves as a body force (similar to gravity)
 acting in the direction opposite to the acceleration of the airfoil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Acceleration was ignored in this solution...
 body forces not solved...
 For this velocity distribution the acceleration term peaked at a ≈ 25 m/s
 2 ≈ 2.5g.
 The gravity term is usu- ally negligible in most aerodynamic applications
 and, in this problem, the forces due to the acceleration term are of the
 same order of magnitude as gravity.
 In addition, the acceleration term is only acting for very short periods
 of time when the airfoil is impulsively started or stopped.
 For these reasons, it seems reasonable to neglect the effect of the acceleratio
n in this problem.

The most remarkable result is the sudden jump of the lift and drag when
 the acceleration occurs and the little impact that viscosity has on the
 value of the coefficients during this acceleration.
 The low influence of the viscous stresses is striking considering that,
 as discussed in Section 2.3, viscosity is responsible for the formation
 of the starting vortex and the development of the circulation that leads
 to the lift force in steady state.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once the lift and drag coefficients were computed it was found that both
 peaked during the accelerations and decelerations due to added mass effects
 and that the effect of the viscous stresses on lift was modest even if
 viscosity is responsible for the development of lift.
 In addition, the solution was verified using the Kelvin’s circulation theorem.
 Both the line integral of the velocity and the surface integral of vorticity
 matched with reasonable accuracy and were almost equal to zero for an inviscid
 contour and non-zero for viscid contours.

 equation for an incompressible fluid with uniform density,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial t}+\left(\vec{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\omega=\left(\omega\cdot\nabla\right)\vec{u}+\nu\nabla^{2}\omega
\]

\end_inset

...
 The first term on the right is a processing term describing the local amplifica
tion (or concentration) of vorticity by stretching and tilting the vortex
 filaments.
 The second term on the right represents viscous diffusion, i.e.
 the spreading of vorticity due to viscosity.
 For homogeneous fluid, vorticity is generated only at boundaries.
 Batchelor (1967) concluded that the boundary conditions on vorticity are
 given, in effect, by those on velocity.

Abstract & Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In this paper we describe a detailed study of the wake structures and flow
 dynamics associated with simulated two-dimensional flows past a circular
 cylinder that is either stationary or in simple harmonic cross-flow oscillation.
 Results are examined for Re = 500 and a fixed motion amplitude of y max
 /D = 0.25
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Results are interpreted using an analysis of vorticity generation and transport
 in the base region of the cylinder.
 We suggest that the dynamics of the change in phase of shedding arise from
 a competition between two different mechanisms of vorticity production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Reynolds number was set sufficiently high for the switch phenomenon
 to be observed at the oscillation amplitude employed.
 The restriction to a single amplitude and Reynolds number, and especially
 to two-dimensional computations, was made in order to contain the demand
 on computer resources while still providing useful insight.

Understanding this type of fluid–structure interaction is made more complicated
 by the difficulty of visualizing and measuring the large-scale separated
 flow near a moving body.
 More fundamentally, the flows are complex and time-varying, and there are
 few theoretical results available to guide interpretation.
 We have taken a numerical simulation approach in order to overcome the
 operational difficulties and better understand the physical processes involved.

A spectral element spatial discretization was employed in conjunction with
 a second-order time-splitting scheme (Karniadakis, Israeli & Orszag 1991)
 in order to solve the two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.
 The solver uses a primitive-variable formulation.
 Vorticity, when required for presentation of results, was computed in post-proc
essing.
 Details of the method, its application to two-dimensional and three-dimensional
 simulations and stability analyses of fixed cylinder wakes, and comparisons
 with experimental results are discussed in Hen- derson & Karniadakis (1995),
 Henderson (1995), Barkley & Henderson (1996) and Henderson (1997).

\begin_layout Itemize
Four key concepts can be used as aids to interpretation of vorticity contours.
 First, continuity demands that separation and (re)attachment points must
 occur in pairs for a two-dimensional flow.
 Second, in the frame of reference of the body, separation and attachment
 occur at points of zero surface vorticity, as may be verified by a study
 of figure 4.
 Both these concepts are dealt with in detail by Lighthill (1963).
 Third, in an incompressible flow, vorticity production can only occur at
 a solid boundary in response to wall-tangential components of pressure
 gradient and/or boundary acceleration.
 For a two-dimensional flow of a Newtonian incompressible fluid the equation
 for the vorticity source strength at solid walls in an inertial reference
 frame reads (Morton 1984; Hornung 1989):
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-\nu\vec{n}\cdot\nabla\vec{\omega}=-\vec{n}\times\left(\nabla\vec{P}+\vec{a}\right)\tag{Eq 6.1}
\]

\end_inset

This equation expresses the idea that vorticity must diffuse away from a
 solid boundary at the same rate that it is produced by local conditions.
 Fourth, for flow past a body that has no angular acceleration, the integral
 around the body perimeter of the flux of vorticity is zero at every instant,
 which is a consequence of (6.1) and the continuity of the pressure field:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ointop-\nu\vec{n}\cdot\nabla\vec{\omega}\,\text{d}S=\ointop-\nu\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial n}\,\text{d}S=0
\]

When the cylinder accelerates downwards (as in figures 5a–c and f–h) this
 mechanism acts to produce fluxes of negative vorticity on the front cylinder
 face and positive vorticity on the rear face.
 Quantitatively these fluxes are of larger magnitude in figure 5(f–j ) since
 the acceleration is larger than in 5(a–e) by the square of the ratio of
 the frequency ratios (a factor of 1.24).

Competition between vorticity generation mechanisms:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The key feature is the relative strengths of, and competition between, the
 pressure gradient and motion-induced vorticity production on the basal
 surface.
 In the case of low-frequency oscillations (e.g.
 figure 5 a–e), shear layers are perturbed such that they roll up first
 on the side of the wake towards which the body is moving.
 Pressure gradients associated with this roll-up tend to induce vorticity
 of opposite sign on the basal surface (as in figure 5b, c).
 The surface-acceleration vorticity generation mechanism opposes this production
, but is not strong enough to override it.

At higher oscillation frequencies (e.g.
 figure 5 f–j ), the surface-acceleration production mechanism has been
 able to override the pressure gradient mechanism on the basal surface of
 the cylinder.
 A very intense basal shear layer forms, inducing earlier roll-up of the
 main shear layer from the opposite side of the cylinder than occurs in
 the lower frequency case.
 In turn there is a feedback effect whereby the pressure gradient produced
 in the roll-up of the main shear layer gives rise to vorticity production
 that reinforces the tangential acceleration mechanism.
 The strength of the main shear layer that is rolling up is enhanced, in
 order to achieve the balance indicated by the integral constraint (6.2).

Simulations with reduced motion-induced vorticity production:
\begin_inset Newline newline

In order to test the hypothesis that the controlling feature in the phase
 switch is the relative importance of pressure-gradient and motion-induced
 vorticity production, we have carried out simulations in which the motion-induc
ed vorticity production was lowered artificially in the manner indicated
 by (9.3).
 No modification is required to the numerical solution technique, other
 than to impose a set of time-varying velocity boundary conditions on the
 cylinder surface.
 Since the velocities are tangential, there is no direct interaction with
 the pressure through the Neumann boundary condition (5.3).

Starting from the Kármán wake solutions obtained for F = 0.875 and F = 0.975
 (as for figure 5), the relative motion of the cylinder surface was gradually
 increased from rest, by increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $β$
\end_inset

 from 0 to 1 over a period T U/D = 100 until the motion- induced vorticity
 production was zero everywhere on the circumference.
 This resulted in the F = 0.875 solution changing to another with a periodic
 Kármán street wake, and an increased value of E.
 In contrast, the periodicity of the F = 0.975 solution was destroyed by
 this procedure, leading to a chaotic wake flow.
 Subsequently it was discovered that a periodic solution could also be obtained
 at F = 0.975 if the motion-induced vorticity production was reduced by a
 lesser amount.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $β$
\end_inset

 max = 0.5 this produced a Kármán street wake, with a negative value of E,
 similar in magnitude to that for the cylinder with the fixed surface at
 the same value of F.

 (84) reduces to their expression of impulse.
 Changes in notation from [2] have been made for consistency with the present

von Kármán and Sears [2] express the instantaneous lift on an airfoil as
 the time derivative of total impulse, whose magnitude 
\begin_inset Formula $|P|$

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|P\right|=\intop_{-\frac{c}{2}}^{\frac{c}{2}}\gamma_{0}\left(x\right)x\,\text{d}x+\intop_{\frac{c}{2}}^{\infty}\gamma\left(x\right)x\,\text{d}x+\intop_{\frac{c}{2}}^{\infty}\gamma\left(x\right)\left[\sqrt{x^{2}-\left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^{2}}-x\right]\,\text{d}x
\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{0}$
\end_inset

 represents the distribution of vorticity on the chord associated with the
 freestream velocity and body motion.
 The three integrals are on the right-hand side of Eq.
 (86) are the potential, shed- vorticity, and image-vorticity impulses,
 in that order.
 Through simple algebra, it can be shown that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sqrt{x^{2}-\left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^{2}}-x=-\frac{c}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2x^{*}+\sqrt{\left(2x^{*}\right)^{2}-1}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{*}=\frac{x}{c}$
\end_inset

.
 The term in large parentheses on the right-hand side is equivalent to the
 right-hand side of Eq.
 (85) when one assumes that all shed-vorticity fluid elements lie on the
 positive x axis (real line).
 When the pitch amplitude is assumed to be small, it can be assumed that
 P = P and Eq.
 (84) represents a generalization of the impulse formula of von Kármán and
 Sears [2] which removes the planar-wake restriction.
 When pitch amplitudes are not small, P can be rotated to yield P using
 Eq.
 (78), providing a general means of calculating force which is valid for
 any motion of the plate and any concomitant vorticity-field evolution.

The well-known decomposition of aerodynamic force into added-mass and circulator
y components has its origins in potential flow theory.
 In the classical decomposition, shed vorticity is represented by vortex
 singularities, whose associated potential can be linearly superimposed
 onto the single-valued potential which gives rise to the added-mass force.
 The present work shows that this decomposition is also valid for viscous,
 separated flows containing continuous distributions of vorticity, as demonstrat
ed by means of a Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity field.
 The resulting equations are valid for an impermeable body of arbitrary
 geometry, in two or three dimensions, undergoing arbitrary motion through
 an unbounded, incompressible fluid domain.
 The force acting on the body is related to the time derivative of total
 impulse P defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=P_{v}+P_{i}+P_{\phi}+P_{b}
\]

\end_inset

The four terms on the right-hand side are the shed-vorticity impulse, the
 image-vorticity impulse, the potential impulse, and the body-volume impulse,
 respectively.
 Upon time differentiation, the first two terms give rise to the circulatory
 force and the latter two combine to give the classical added-mass force.
 The generality of the derivation demonstrates that the added-mass force
 is a valid component of total force regardless of the presence of a vortical
 wake.
 The presented force formulation was shown to be equivalent to existing
 theoretical work, under the specific conditions and assumptions of previous
 studies [2,5,7,21,23].
 The force formulation was also validated using a numerical data set generated
 by Wang and Eldredge [21], wherein the flow around a pitching plate in
 a steady freestream was simulated.
 The calculated force shows fairly good agreement with the force reported
 by Wang and Eldredge [21], although minor discrepancies indicate that further
 work must be done to quantify errors due to discretization.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When the no-slip condition holds, it was shown that the total impulse can
 be equivalently expressed as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=P_{v}+P_{b}
\]

\end_inset

which indicates that the no-slip condition causes the potential impulse
 and image-vorticity impulse terms to cancel for all time, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}+P_{\phi}\equiv0$
\end_inset

 .
 Such cancellation was indeed shown to hold in the Wang-Eldredge data set
 [21].
 This relationship could prove valuable to future predictive aerodynamic
 models; the potential impulse can be calculated for all time a priori based
 on body geometry and motion, which in turn places an integral restriction
 on the evolution of the vorticity field.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Two key insights regarding the classical added-mass force were emphasized.
 First, for bodies of nonzero volume, the added-mass force differs depending
 on whether body itself accelerates or whether the freestream flow accelerates
 relative to the body.
 This is a known phenomenon in the marine literature, but may be overlooked
 in other fields.
 Second, the most general expression for the added-mass force acting on
 an accelerating flat plate includes a tangential component.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Misinterpretations of added mass persist in the literature, wherein the
 added-mass force is attributed to the acceleration of fluid that must move
 with the body.
 By inspection of the derived impulse terms, the authors adhere to the more
 physically accurate interpretation that the added-mass force accounts for
 the dynamic effect of the near-body vorticity distribution, without defining
 a specific contour or associated region of fluid.
 This interpretation arises due to the cancellation of the shed-vorticity
 and image-vorticity impulse terms near the body surface.
 Such cancellation reduces the importance of acquiring accurate near-body
 vorticity data, which could be advantageous in application to experimental
 data sets.
 Investigation of the experimental utility of the presented force formulation
 is left for future work.

The thin-airfoil lift formula is derived by using the simple lift formula
 that contains the vortex lift and the lift associated with the fluid accelerati
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Thin-airfoil theory originally developed by Munk [1] uses a vortex sheet
 in a potential flow to model an actual flow over a thin airfoil, in which
 the Kutta condition is imposed at the trailing edge to calculate the lift
 and moment...
 Recently, because of the renewed interests in active flutter control and
 flapping flight, considerable efforts have been made to apply thin-airfoil
 theory to unsteady flows associated with aeroelastic, flapping, and flexible
 wings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The formulation given by von Kármán and Sears [6] based on the application
 of the vortex impulse is particularly insightful because the unsteady lift
 is explicitly expressed as a sum of the quasi-steady Kutta–Joukowski lift,
 the added-mass lift, and the wake-induced contribution.

The wake-induced term leads to the so-called deficiency preventing the instantan
eous lift from attaining the quasi-steady state immediately.
 Interestingly, the von Kármán– Sears formulation remains the same when
 the nonlinear effects induced by the wake are incorporated by McCune and
 Tavares [14].
 This implies that the von Kármán–Sears lift formula could be more generic
 in terms of its physical foundations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The physical foundations of thin-airfoil theory were discussed by Glauert
 [15].
 His argument is that a vortex sheet is a limiting model of a boundary layer
 on the airfoil surface as the viscosity approaches to zero and the integration
 of the vortex sheet strength is equal to the magnitude of the circulation
 generating the lift.
 The relationship between unsteady boundary-layer vorticity and bound-vortex
 sheet strength was further discussed by Sears [16] along with the generalized
 Kutta–Joukowski condition for a blunt trailing edge.
 It is clear that a bound-vortex sheet in thin-airfoil theory represents
 the airfoil plus its boundary layer, and the circulation is intimately
 connected with the boundary-layer.
 It is proposed by Sears [16] that the lift and moment are calculated by
 using thin-airfoil theory, and the circulation is determined by boundary-layer
 calculation such that thin-airfoil theory could be applied to a body with
 boundary-layer separation near the blunt trailing edge.
 Although these conceptual arguments are physically compelling, a derivation
 of unsteady thin- airfoil theory from the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations
 has not been systematically given in the general framework of viscous flows.
 The feasible derivation should be based on a general force expression for
 viscous flows.

...Wang et al.
 [26] circumvented this pressure problem by selecting a rectangular control
 volume to obtain a very simple but sufficiently accurate lift formula.
 It is found that, for a rectangular control surface whose upper and lower
 faces are sufficiently far away from a wing, the contributions of the third
 and fourth terms in the RHS of Eq.
 (2) to the lift generation can be neglected.
 Thus, the lift can be approximately decomposed into the two dominant terms:
 the vortex force and the fluid acceleration.
 This leads to the simple lift formula that is useful in an analysis of
 the connection between vortical structures and lift generation in complex
 unsteady flows associated with flapping wings.
 The accuracy of the simple lift formula has been evaluated via direct numerical
 simulation (DNS) for unsteady low-Reynolds- number flows [26].

\begin_layout Itemize
After a calculation of the induction effects of a wake vortex, formulae
 for the lift and moment are obtained which are applicable to all cases
 of motion of a two-dimensional thin airfoil in which the wake produced
 is approximately flat; i.e., in which the movement of the airfoil normal
 to its mean path is small.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The airfoil put into motion creates a circulation around it- self due to
 the presence of the sharp trailing edge; however, according to the theorem
 of conservation of moment of momentum, a counter-circulation develops in
 the fluid, called the "starting vortex.'' The airfoil and the starting vortex
 constitute a vortex-pair with an increasing distance between the two vortex
 lines, be- cause the starting vortex remains at the place where it was
 created (neglecting its slow displacement perpen- dicular to the flight
 direction).
 Hence the momentum of the vortex pair, being proportional to the product
 of the circulation and the distance between the two vortices, increases
 continuously.
 The rate of this in-crease of the momentum is equal to the lift.

 However, if the total circulation around the airfoil is variable, because
 of non-uniformity of the motion, the airfoil leaves a wake composed of
 continuously distributed vortex lines behind itself, and the influence
 of this wake must be taken into account.
 The intensity of the vortex lines which constitute the wake is determined
 in this case by two conditions: (a) that the total circulation of the whole
 system is invariably equal to zero, and (b) that the wake vortices move
 with the fluid, e.g., if the undisturbed fluid is at rest they keep their
 positions in space while the airfoil proceeds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method presented in this paper is based on the idea that the momentum
 per unit span o£ the system can be expressed by the sum of the momentum
 of the vortex pairs which constitute the system, where the momentum of
 each particular vortex pair is given by the product of the circulation
 and the distance between the individual vortices.
 ...
\begin_inset Newline newline

If the strengths of the two vortices of a particular vortex pair are denoted
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm\Gamma$
\end_inset

, and the X-coordinates of the two vortices by 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 , then the magnitude of the momentum is 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\Gamma\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the line of action of the momentum, due to symmetry, is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right)/2$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently, the moment of the momentum with respect to the origin of
 the coordinate system is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\Gamma\left(x_{2}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}\right)/2$
\end_inset

 and it is seen that the total moment of momentum of the system is given
 by the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{1}{2}\rho\sum\left(\Gamma_{i}x_{i}^{2}\right)\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma'_{0}\left(\tau\right)\Phi\left(U\left(t-\tau\right)\right)\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 and the total deficiency in lift will be given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-L_{2}=\rho U\intop_{0}^{t}\Gamma_{0}'\left(\tau\right)\Phi\left(U\left(t-\tau\right)\right)\,\text{d}\tau\tag{Eq 42}
\]

\end_inset

In this equation it is assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{0}\left(0\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 If, at the instant 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{0}$
\end_inset

 is suddenly increased from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\left(0\right)$
\end_inset

, a term equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{0}\Phi\left(Ut\right)$
\end_inset

 is to be added to the right-hand side of Eq 42.

The elementary case of a sudden unit increment in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{0}$
\end_inset

 has been treated by Wagner, and the function 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\Phi$
\end_inset

 is equal to his 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{A}{2b\pi\rho v_{p}^{2}\sin\left(\beta\right)}$
\end_inset

 (see page 31 of reference 5; also Fig 9 and Table 2).
 Thus the lift and moment can be calculated by Eqs 16a and 20, for a given
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{0}\left(x,t\right)$
\end_inset

 distribution...

The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi\left(Ut\right)$
\end_inset

...
 can be fairly closely approximated by the following relatively simple formulae...

(a) for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\sigma\le2$
\end_inset

 the following power series can be used
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Phi\left(\sigma\right)=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sigma}{8}+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{32}-0.00554\sigma^{3}\tag{Eq 43}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Itemize
(b) for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\sigma\le10$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Phi\left(\sigma\right)=\frac{e^{-\frac{\sigma}{2}}}{4}+\left(1+0.185\sigma\right)\frac{e^{-0.185\sigma}}{4}\tag{Eq 44}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\Phi$
\end_inset

 enters in the final result, and since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi\left(\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 is very small for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma>10$
\end_inset

, Eq 44 can be applied for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\le\sigma\le\infty$
\end_inset

 without introducing important errors.

Processing these image data with modern PIV algorithms allows the visualization
 of flow quantities (e.g.
 vorticity) that were unavailable prior to the development of the PIV technique.
 The accompanying fluid dynamics video consists of selected original film

Further analysis of the displacement (velocity) data show a periodic jitter
 which is caused by frame-to-frame image registration jitter, most likely
 introduced during the orig- inal recording process ...
 It is also removed when finite difference are applied to the displacement
 fields and therefore does not appear in the presented vorticity maps.
