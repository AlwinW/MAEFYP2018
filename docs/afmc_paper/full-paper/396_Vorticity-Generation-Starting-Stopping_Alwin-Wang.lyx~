\begin_layout Abstract
This paper presents a numerical study of vorticity generation around a 2D
 airfoil during the starting and stopping phases of motion.
 The study focuses on a single NACA0012 airfoil of unit chord where the
 two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a spectral element
 DNS code.

 Both studies determined coefficients of lift and drag during the starting

 This paper extends on these studies by considering the vorticity generation
 mechanisms and exploring the physical phenomina behind leading edge vortices
 observed during the stopping phase.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Acceleration of a body (dense particles) through a fluid will accelerate
 the fluid surrounding the body as a result of work done by body on fluid.
 Thus this body-induced acceleration can be related to an additional mass
 (F=ma) and eventually a virtual mass that is called added mass.

It is recognised that the sources of vorticity must occur at the boundary
 of the fluid regions and for the starting and starting and stopping phases
 of motion, Morton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 outlines two production mechanisms for vorticity: tangential pressure gradients
 from the fluid side, and the acceleration of the surface from the wall
 side (shown in Eq 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

plural "false"

).
 These contributions were investigated by Blackburn and Henderson

 for vortex shedding of oscillating cylinders and it was noted that the
 pressure-gradient generation mechanism could override the surface-acceleration
 generation mechanism and vice verse.

\begin{equation}
-\nu\left(\frac{\partial\vec{\omega}}{\partial z}\right)_{0}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\left[\left(\vec{n}\times\nabla\right)\vec{p}\right]_{0}-\vec{n}\times\frac{\text{d}V}{\text{d}t}\label{eq:Morton Full VortGen}

 Additionally, the realisation of the Kutta condition and creation of starting
 vortex was determined to be through a complex chain of processes which
 were also explained by considering boundary vorticity flux (BVF),

 After the starting phase when the airfoil has attained a uniform velocity,
 it was also observed the lift force would asymptote to a steady-state value.
