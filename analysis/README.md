## Analysis

**Purpose**
* Conduct analysis in this folder
* Results from analysis will be used in the investigation
* Use tests folder for bug fixing, benchmarking, etc

**Structure**
* Each analysis has its own folder
* A subfolder results is used to store DNS output
* A subfolder output is used to store image, RData, etc

# bash [depreciated]
 - Used to store bash scripts that were used early on 

# convg [functional]
 - Convergence analysis for t = 1.05s (peak +ve acceleration)

# kutta [depreciated]
 - Analysis of the kutta condition by making custom plotting functions
 - Moved to Tecplot analysis now

# mesh [visualisation]
 - Create graphics for different meshes

# panel [functional]
 - Panel method for unsteady flow

# remesh_lete [depreciated]
 - Code and files used to remesh the airfoil to be finer at LE & TE

# start [visualisation]
 - Tecplot visualisation of the starting flow

# vortgen [depreciated]
 - Analysis of the airfoil

# whole [visualisation]
 - Visualisation of the flow for all time steps
